"""Language-conditioned task registry for RadeonVLA-Reflex.

Task tiers
----------
L1 Basic        — name a fruit + left/right bowl (single goal)
L2 Spatial      — grounding by spatial relation (leftmost / rightmost / nearest)
L3 Multi-step   — ordered multi-object sequences in one episode
L4 Rule-based   — attribute rules (e.g. yellow→left, purple→right)

The scripted expert and closed-loop policy execute a resolved goal list from
``radeonvla.grounding.resolve_task`` after each scene randomization.
